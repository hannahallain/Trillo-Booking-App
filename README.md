# Trillo Booking App Project

### A travel booking page for the fictional company: Trillo. Built entirely out of HTML & SCSS using flexbox to design the layout. 

This project is still in progress - Responsive elements coming soon.


This project was part of the Udemy course: Advanced CSS and Sass: Flexbox, Grid, Animations and More by Jonas Schmedtmannn. The creative design elements belong to Jonas, however I did make some adjustments to match more modern designs, since this course is a few years old now.
